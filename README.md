Scrapes UOW SOLS.

You need to run this on your own.

Uses selenium + chrome headless, so you will need to have chrome installed.

Requires ptb, selenium, python >= 3.4

If you don't know how to run this, this isn't meant for you to use it...

Written in approx 1h+, tested on arch linux with Google Chrome 65.0.3325.146 with Python 3.6.4 with Selenium v 3.10.0
